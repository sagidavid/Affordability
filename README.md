# Affordability

## Introduction

This repository was made for the app that I have developed for the GDS Data Science Accelerator.

The app is hosted here:

https://davidsagi.shinyapps.io/Affordability/

A description of the GDS Data Science Accelerator can be found here:

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into a Data Analysis and a Data Visualisation folders.

The Data Analysis folder contains all the input files (geogrpahies and rent data) and the code that formats it prior to visualisation.

The Data Visualisation folder only contains code that is neccessary for the Shiny app to run.

NOTE: When reproducing the code Data Analysis has to be run before Data Visualisation
